  |   The Shapeshifting Detective is a supernatural-noir murder mystery     |
  |   FMV game. Play as a detective and investigate the murder by           |
  |   shapeshifting into any character. Even the next victim.               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Dorota Shaw is dead. And the prime suspects are three tarot readers   |
  |   with the uncanny ability to predict murder - or commit it. It's       |
  |   your job to find out what else they know - but they won't reveal      |
  |   their dark secrets to just anyone... Luckily, you can be anyone you   |
  |   want to be.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The game features more than 1600 full HD video responses, a simple    |
  |   questioning interface with unique 'delete' mechanic, and a randomly   |
  |   chosen murderer at the start of the game. Developed by the World      |
  |   Record-breaking makers of "The Infectious Madness of Doctor           |
  |   Dekker".                                                              |

  |   * Shapeshift - into nine other characters so you can investigate      |
  |     and manipulate relationships from all angles, and unlock the        |
  |     other half of the story                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Suspense - solve a murder, stop a murder, don't get caught. Any     |
  |     one of three random murderers helps to minimize spoilers            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Choices matter - catch the killer, save the victims, make and       |
  |     break relationships - or don't                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Problem solving - can't get that vital clue yourself? Try           |
  |     shapeshifting into the Police Chief. Think the dialogue options     |
  |     are a trap? Delete them                                             |
  |                                                                         |
